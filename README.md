## Predicting Alzheimer's-related Dementia Using Machine Learning

### Alzheimer's disease and dementia

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with an unspecified cause and pathogenesis which primarily affects older people. One of the early symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease is dementia, a general term for memory loss and other cognitive dysfunctions serious enough to interfere with the patient's daily life. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-80% of dementia cases in the world. The disease has no cure, but some treatments can temporarily slow the worsening of dementia symptoms and improve the quality of life for AD patients and their caregivers. 

### Motivation & Goal

Given the fact that currently there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, it is very critical to diagnose the disease at its early stage. A treatment performed at an early stage of the disease is more effective with fewer side effects than a treatment given at a later stage.

Machine learning (ML) has been used in biomedical research, and there is much interest in applying ML to help diagnose diseases like AD that affect a large population around the world. The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that may help clinicians make accurate diagnoses of AD. Multiple ML model such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector machine are used to determine the optimal analytic approach and identify the number of variables required. For each model, the performance is measured by parameters like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
